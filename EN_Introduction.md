# Introduction

Major General Smedley Darlington Butler was born on 30-July-1881 in West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA to Thomas Stalker Butler (1854-1928) and Maud Mary (Darlington) Butler (1855-1936). He recieved his education at the Haverford School and was married to Ethel C. Peters of Philadelphia on 30-June-1905. Mr. and Mrs. Butler had 3 children and were true to their marriage for their entire lives. They are buried next to each other.

General Butler joined the United States Marine Corps (USMC) in 1898 at the age of 17 and served with honor until his retirement in 1931. He served his nation for a total of 33 years and 4 months. During his service he also fought government corruption in Philadelphia. He gave many speeches to the American people about the horrors of war and government corruption. During his service in the USMC he rose through the ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major General.

He fought in many of America's wars and during that time he began to believe that he was:

 "... a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism." 
 
Like most Americans today, he was raised on fairy tales of America's moral superiority. In the beginning he did not understand what was really happening, but as he matured he came to understand that the government of the United States of America was controlled by oligarchs that used the US military to force other nations to become vassals of the US government and the business interests and oligarches that controlled it. This is the definition of fascism according to Bennito Mussolini: busineses and oligarchs controlling the government, openly or in secret. 

General Butler was a devoted and capable enemy of fascism. This story has been suppressed by the American fascists: In 1934 he was approached by a group of Wall Street oligarchs who offered him a large sum of money. These oligarchs asked him to lead 500,000 soldiers against President Franklin Deleanor Roosevelt and forcibly remove him from office. These oligarchs attempted a coup because they did not want to pay their fair share of taxes. General Butler collected information on these men and gave the information to the US Congress -- He honored his Oath to the US Constitution and crushed the coup attempt by his actions.

General Butler was awarded two Congressional Medals of Honor:

-   The first was in 1914 for his actions during the capture of Vera Cruz, Mexico.
-   The second was in 1917 for his actions during the capture of Ft. Riviere, Haiti.
-   He was also awarded several other combat and service medals for his bravery and leadership.

He Died at the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 21-June-1940, He was 58 years old. 

The USMC Base "Camp Butler" is named after him:
